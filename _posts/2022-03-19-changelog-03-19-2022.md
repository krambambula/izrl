_It's been a busy week._

**Doors - the first prototype - done**
In fact, a unique tile has now been added, which allows you to separate zones. Before entering a room with a door, we do not know what is inside. After entering - the lighting remains only indoors. ([gif](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg0NTI2MjUuZ2lm/original/4ApKuZ.gif))

**Player's ranged weapon - done**
Now not only monsters can shoot from afar, but also the player. The first ranged weapon was the sling. The player turns on the ranged attack mode on the hotkey and can attack. ([gif](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg0NTI2NDcuZ2lm/original/tqOpMr.gif))

**Loot system - done**
Realized the old dream of a loot system. Full customization for drop-down items. You can set a 100% drop chance if you want the loot to drop out exactly. Regular % on loot is 25%. In addition to all supported items ([gif](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg0NTI2NDguZ2lm/original/A3lLaO.gif)), other monsters can drop from monsters. First of all, this formed the basis for immortal skeletons (more on them later), but I think to add in other variations. For example: when a spider egg is destroyed, 4-5 spiders run out.

**Gold - correct generation - done**
Previously, all gold owned by a monster was created at the time the monster was created on the map. And because all monsters of the same type are clones, then everyone had the same number of coins in their pocket. Now, gold is created at the moment of the death of the monster and is tied precisely to his death. Therefore, the number of coins is unique.

**Immortal mobs - done**
As I wrote above, based on the loot system, I made a type of creatures that do not know death. The first creatures of this type were skeletons. When they die, they not only do not disappear, but also rise again, calling for help more and more skeletons ([gif](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg0NTI2NTQuZ2lm/original/2xQzC6.gif)). At the moment, it is impossible to deal with such units. Just run away. But there are plans to add items that can remove the spell of immortality from skeletons.

**First quest - done**
The first quest became very banal. It is required to destroy 3 demons.

What has been created?

- Quest NPC - which issues the quest ([screenshot of the quest issue window](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg0NTI2NjAucG5n/original/h2NuyY.png))
- A window with an active quest ([screenshot](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg0NTI2NjUucG5n/original/B3jYrF.png)). You can track progress. How many demons have been destroyed. As soon as all 3 demons are destroyed, information is displayed in the window that it is worth returning to the quest NPC ([screenshot](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg0NTI2NzAucG5n/original/mDfZTE.png)).
- Progress in the process of completing the quest is fixed additionally in the chat.
- Reward window. After completing the quest, we return for a reward. ([screenshot](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg0NTI2NzQucG5n/original/VC9IuW.png)) The chat displays information about the successful completion of the quest. ([screenshot](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg0NTI3NTQucG5n/original/C%2BxRqB.png))

In quest plans, do quests with hidden objects or hidden secret rooms.

_And that's all for now._
