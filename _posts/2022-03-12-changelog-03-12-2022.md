## So another week has passed...

### Lantern - done
Own light source in the field of view.
An example of a single lantern ([gif](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzgzOTMwMDAuZ2lm/original/VEaRBp.gif)), lanterns in the demon city ([gif](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzgzOTI5NzkuZ2lm/original/cgVkW6.gif)).

### Traps - done
Traps are now invisible and hold the player in place until they get out of the trap. Maybe in the future I will add a chance not to get out of the trap and get additional damage.

### Invisibility/Visibility Potion - done
After drinking the potion, the player becomes invisible ([gif](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzgzOTMwMDguZ2lm/original/G2%2Bzou.gif)). In order to restore visibility - you need to drink a potion of visibility.
