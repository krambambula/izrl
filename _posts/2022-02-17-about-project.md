IZBISHE is roguelike game that was inspired by slavic folklore. 
In the center of the plot is a stranger who inherits an old house in the wilderness. There was an old basement next to the house. Our hero went down inside and sorting through the rubble found the entrance to the underworld.

The story line is based on various folk tales about devils and the underworld. I'm also drew inspiration from the stories of Nikolai Gogol. I will give one of the plots that will be found in the game. Often in folk tales, devils gather sinners all over the district and take them on a wagon to the underworld, chasing them in the back with a whip.

Because it the roguelike project, he will have a minimum of a plot, but a lot of references and replicas of various NPCs. And the main plot leading to the main boss can be guessed.

Core mechanics:
The core mechanic in the game is the sin system. The more sins you accumulate, the weaker your hero becomes. (but you do not know for what you will receive sin, and for what not).

There are two gameplay options here:
1) You get rid of sins by all means and buy, knock out and get rare and powerful items;
2) You accumulate a huge amount of sins and die. 
Or not?
In fact, there is permadeath in my game, but with its own nuances. Having accumulated a lot of sins, you get access to "dark" shops where items are sold for sins, and not for gold. And each purchase only increases the number of sins you have. And because the body is mortal from debuffs, then you can change the body and move into the body of another (demonic) creature. The game continues on behalf of this creature. He can also carry items, use shops, but has different stats and different faction traits. His allys do not beat him. In short, I will post more details in the game's devblog.
