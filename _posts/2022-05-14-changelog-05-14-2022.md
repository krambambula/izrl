**Refactoring**

Engaged in refactoring of all the accumulated functionality. First I want to complete it - so that I can continue calmly.

However, some new features have been added.

**Weapon wearout**

To make life even more difficult for the player, I have long wanted to make restrictions for various types of weapons. Now all the equipment available in the game does not last forever and breaks down over time and is not usable.

The only thing that can be done with such equipment is to sell it to a merchant.

In the inventory, such stuff is marked with the label "broken".

**Can't fight with bare hands**

As is clear from the title, now even to defeat a simple rat, you need a stick, a sword, a bow, or at least something else. You can't fight monsters with your bare hands.
