_It's been a very busy week and not much has been done._

Last week I already wrote that I would do additional functionality for game classes.

**Ranger ideas completed first**

I wrote about ranged weapons earlier, in this comment I will talk about ranger traps for monsters and about their installation.

I had to modify the traps once again. From new:

- trap types
- traps set by the player and not
- monsters AI - holds the monster in the trap for the required number of moves

And the frosting on the cake is setting traps on the map at the selected location. Changed the char for the traps that the player places ([gif](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg1NDU0MDYuZ2lm/original/tgD8Eh.gif)).

In essence, from the ideas voiced earlier, the ranger is now completely ready to hunt devils.

**Pickaxe - done**

Fixed an issue with the infinite use of a pickaxe. Now the pickaxe works for a strictly limited number of moves and then breaks. If you want to dig walls - buy a new one. ([screenshot](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzg1NDU0MjgucG5n/original/on5aBQ.png))

_That's all folks._
