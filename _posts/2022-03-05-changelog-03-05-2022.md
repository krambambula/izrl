## What's new

Another week has passed.

- Maps
Added DLA (pic) and BSP (pic) map generation and also connected the loading of custom maps from .csv (an example of a demons city).
Actually, the plans include customizing the tiles of the city, filling it with NPC, making lanterns.

- Pets
Added AI for pets. The pet follows its owner everywhere. You can pass through a pet (relevant for narrow caves - [an example](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzgzMjk1MTMuZ2lm/original/RBwx%2Fq.gif))

- Sin system
Accumulating sins now debuffs the player's stats.

And that's all for now.
