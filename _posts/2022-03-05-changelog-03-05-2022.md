## What's new

Another week has passed.

**- Maps**
Added DLA ([pic](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzgzMjk1NTIucG5n/original/MgXIIl.png)) and BSP ([pic](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzgzMjk1NTMucG5n/original/rtO0iR.png)) map generation and also connected the loading of custom maps from .csv ([an example of a demons city](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzgzMjk1NTEucG5n/original/2G5Z8r.png)).
Actually, the plans include customizing the tiles of the city, filling it with NPC, making lanterns, doors.

**- Pets**
Added AI for pets. The first pet was a black cat (i couldn't not insert my cat into the game). The pet follows its owner everywhere. You can pass through a pet (relevant for narrow caves - [an example](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzgzMjk1MTMuZ2lm/original/RBwx%2Fq.gif)).

**- Sin system**
Accumulating sins now debuffs the player's stats.

And that's all for now.
