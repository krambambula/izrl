**- Factions - done**

Made basic factions. If you are not one of "ally", then attack, if "ally" - do nothing and do not even show interest.

From ideas, add more leadership, what if the leader is to follow him.

**- Ranged monster attacks - done**
Now monsters also have ranged attacks. Ranged weapons are still in development.

**- Moving neutral monsters, moving NPCs - done**
NPCs have learned to walk randomly. Monsters are not far behind and also know how.

**- Creating traps - fifty/fifty**
The first prototype of the trap has been created. The trigger on the trap works. Two questions hung: how to hide the trap? how to make a semblance of a "stun" in actions.

**- Add caves - drunkards - fifty/fifty**
Added the generation of part of the dungeons according to the Drunkards Walk algorithm. I also want to try the standard generation of caves from the examples in the TCOD.

**- A scroll that reveals the entire map.**
